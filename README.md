# SpringSecurity Project
## OverView
This project demonstrates multiple approaches to secure a Spring Boot application using Spring Security. The application implements various authentication and authorization mechanisms based on user roles. The methods covered include:

- Basic Authentication
- Form-Based Authentication
- Database Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
## Features
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles are granted specific permissions to access certain resources.
- Multiple Authentication Methods:
  - Basic Authentication: Simple and easy authentication method where credentials are sent with each request.
  - Form-Based Authentication: Users log in using a custom login form.
  - Database Authentication: User credentials and roles are stored and managed in a database.
  - JWT Authentication: Secure and scalable token-based authentication that allows stateless sessions.
## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
